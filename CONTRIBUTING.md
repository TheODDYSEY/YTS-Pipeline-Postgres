## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests when applicable (e.g., `Fixes #123`).

### Python Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python code.
- Use type hints as much as possible for better code readability and maintenance.
- Write docstrings for all public modules, functions, classes, and methods.

## Additional Notes

- **Tests**: Ensure your code passes existing tests and add new tests for new features or bug fixes.
- **Documentation**: Update the documentation to reflect your changes, including the README and any relevant comments in the code.
- **Reviews**: Be prepared to address feedback during the review process. We appreciate your patience and effort in making this project better!
